&nbsp; <p style="text-align: left; font-family: raleway; font-size: 25px;"> <strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;WELCOME TO CITY GALLERY. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> </p>
<p class="a">
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are an artist run gallery featuring exhibitions of contemporary painting, printmaking, sculpture, photography,  and fiber arts.  Our exhibits rotate monthly, with each artist featured in a solo show or in a small group show of three or four member artists. Our membership is intentionally kept to fewer than twenty artists in order to maximize each artist’s opportunity to exhibit work.
    <p class="a">
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To coincide with New Haven’s annual long standing celebration of the visual arts during the month of October, City Gallery presents a show that includes all its member artists.
        <p class="a">
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our mission is to present innovative professional art exhibitions.  We seek to focus on  the creative interaction among ourselves, and the viewing public, to enrich the greater New Haven visual arts community as a vibrant  regional  arts center, and to attract and encourage diverse multigenerational artists from among the varied cultures and ethnicities that comprise the greater New Haven community.

&nbsp; <p style="text-align: center; font-family: raleway; font-size: 25px;"> <strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;HISTORY OF THE BEGINNINGS OF CITY GALLERY &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN NEW HAVEN &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> </p>
<p class="a">
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    In 2003 nine artists formed an innovative, co-operative gallery on State Street in New Haven. The members shared the cost of the rent and utilities etc. and rotated the responsibilities of running the gallery. </p>
    <p class="a">
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janet Van Horne was responsible for making the gallery a reality. She invited eight other artists to join her in finding a suitable location. They were: Caroline Chandler, Pamela Dear, Jane Harris, Mary Lou Horan, Sheila Kaczmarek, Connie Pfeiffer, Margot Rocklen, and Deborah Zervas. They located suitable gallery space on upper State Street and, after making several renovations, they opened in July 2003.
        <p class="a">
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nine artists had three group shows during that first summer; and then, in the Fall, they invited ten other artists to exhibit with them.  As a result, Meg Bloom and Barbara Harder came on board as did Nancy Eisenfeld a few months later.
            <p class="a">
                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each artist had a solo show about once a year to which they could invite other artists, musicians and dancers to perform and exhibit in the gallery. The gallery also holds several group shows a year.
                <p class="a">
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;City Gallery has continued to flourish and, although the membership has changed and expanded, through the years, the basic premise remains the same - that of providing an opportunity for the public to view innovative, contemporary art in the Greater New Haven Community.
